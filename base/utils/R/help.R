#' Description of PEcAn
#'
#' The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) is a scientific workflow management
#' tool that is designed to simplify the management of model parameterization,
#' execution, and analysis. The goal of PEcAn is to streamline the interaction
#' between data and models, and to improve the efficacy of scientific
#' investigation. PEcAn is an open source utility that encapsulates:
#'
#' 1. acquisition of meteorological inputs
#' 2. synthesis of physiological trait data as the posterior distribution of a
#'	  Bayesian meta-analysis
#' 3. sampling trait meta-analysis posterior distributions to parameterize
#'	  ensembles of ED2 and other ecophysiological models
#' 4. probabilistic forecasts
#' 5. postprocessing to constrain forecasts and model parameters with field,
#'	  meterological, eddy flux, and spectral data, and
#' 6. provenance tracking
#'
#' PECAn integrates available data into ecological forecasts by running
#' ensembles of a terrestrial ecosystem model that is parameterized by the
#' posterior distribution from a meta-analysis of available plant trait data.
#' These trait data are assembled from field research and primary literature,
#' and are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Current development focused on
#' biofuel crops uses BETYdb. In addition to generating forecasts that reflect
#' available data, PEcAn quantifies the contribution of each parameter to model
#' uncertainty. This information informs targeted data collection and synthesis
#' efforts that most efficiently reduce forecast uncertainty.
#'
#' Current development is focused on developing PEcAn into a real-time data
#' assimilation and forecasting system. This system will provide a detailed
#' analysis of the past and present ecosystem functioning that seamlessly
#' transitions into forecasts.
